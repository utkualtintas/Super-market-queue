In this project I developed a virtualization of a supermarket queue using Java. User inputs the maximum arrival time of customers, maximum service time of customers at checkout and the total simulation time on a graphical user interface. Then the user can see the live statistics of the queue that is being virtualized. At the end of the simulation, user can see the final state of these stats among with some additional statistics. In this project, I had the chance to practice creating graphical user interfaces, event handling and creating anonymous classes.
